## Objective
Users can input the names of burgers they love to eat.  When a user types the name of the burger, the application displays the burger on the left (Not Devoured).  Once the Burger has been devoured, it will move the right column (Devoured).  The application stores each burger in a database (JAWSdb)

Node and MySql was used to test and query route data and Hanlebars to make sure it's free of errors.  From there, an HTML is generated.
